# Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the connection string:

# mongodb://: The protocol used to connect to MongoDB.
# mongodb: The hostname, which corresponds to the service name defined in the docker-compose.yaml file.
# 27017: The port on which MongoDB is running.
# task-manager: The name of the database to connect to.

MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/task-manager

- To run the docker compose file: docker compose up --build

---
To remove all Docker images, you can use the following command: docker rmi $(docker images -q)

### Explanation

- `docker images -q`: Lists all image IDs.
- `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`: Removes all images using the listed image IDs.

------
Delete all  volumes: docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

There will be no changes to the `MONGO_URI` connection string. The connection string [`mongodb://mongodb:27017/task-manager`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22mongodb%3A%2F%2Fmongodb%3A27017%2Ftask-manager%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") remains the same because the service name [`mongodb`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22mongodb%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is still used as the hostname for the MongoDB service.

### Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Network Setup

1. **Implicit Network Setup**:
   - Docker Compose automatically creates a default network for all services defined in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22docker-compose.yaml%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file.
   - Services can communicate using their service names as hostnames without any additional configuration.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       mongodb:
         image: mongo:7.0
       api:
         build: .
         depends_on:
           - mongodb
         environment:
           - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/task-manager
     ```

2. **Explicit Network Setup**:
   - You define a custom network explicitly in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22docker-compose.yaml%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Falfio%2Fcode%2Fencora%2FGeminiProject%2Fbackend%2Fnotes.txt%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file.
   - Services are attached to this custom network, providing more control over network configuration and isolation.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'

     services:
       mongodb:
         image: mongo:7.0
         networks:
           - app-network
       api:
         build: .
         depends_on:
           - mongodb
         environment:
           - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/task-manager
         networks:
           - app-network

     networks:
       app-network:
         driver: bridge
     ```

### Key Differences

- **Control and Isolation**:
  - **Implicit**: Docker Compose handles network creation and management automatically. 
     All services are part of the default network.
  - **Explicit**: You have explicit control over the network configuration. 
  Services are isolated within the custom network, which can be useful for advanced networking 
  setups or when you need to isolate services from other containers.

- **Configuration**:
  - **Implicit**: Simpler configuration as you don't need to define networks explicitly.
  - **Explicit**: Requires additional configuration to define and attach services to the custom network.

### Summary

Both setups allow services to communicate using their service names as hostnames. 
The explicit network setup provides more control and isolation, which can be beneficial for 
complex applications or specific networking requirements. However, for many use cases, the 
implicit network setup is sufficient and simpler to configure.

- link mongodb:db: Links the mongodb container to the api container and assigns the alias 
   db to the linked container.
- In your application code, you can now use db as the hostname to connect to the MongoDB container.
